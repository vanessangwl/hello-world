# hello-world

Hi, my name is Vanessa, and I'm totally new to Github and coding. 
I hope to learn more about coding as I'm interested in developing new skills in myself (hurr hurr, pun intended). 
The main reason I wish to learn coding is because of my interest in the field of data science. 
Statistics I'm familiar with, but coding? R? Python? What are these things???
